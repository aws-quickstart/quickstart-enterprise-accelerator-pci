==== Prepare your AWS account

===== Create Amazon EC2 Key Pairs

Make sure that at least one Amazon EC2 http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[key pair] exists within your AWS account *in the
Region you are planning to deploy the Quick Start in.*

. Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
. Use the Region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you plan
to deploy.
. In the navigation pane, under *Network & Security*, choose *Key Pairs*.
. In the key pair list, verify that at least one available key pair (but preferably two
available key pairs) exist and make note of the key pair name or names. You’ll need to
provide a key pair name for the parameters `+pEC2KeyPairBastion+` (for bastion host login
access) and `+pEC2KeyPair+` (for all other Amazon EC2 host login access) when you launch 
the Quick Start. Although you can use the same key pair for both parameters, we
recommend that you use a different key pair for each.
+
If you want to create a new key pair, choose *Create Key Pair*. For additional
information, see the http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair[Amazon EC2 documentation].

NOTE: If you’re deploying the Quick Start for testing or proof of concept, we
recommend that you create a new key pair instead of specifying a key pair that’s already
being used by a production instance. 

===== Set up AWS Config

If AWS Config has not yet been initialized in the Region where you are deploying this Quick
Start, follow the steps below *in the Region where you are planning to deploy the
Quick Start*.

. Open the AWS Config console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/config/.
. Use the Region selector in the navigation bar to choose the AWS Region where you plan
to deploy.
. In the AWS Config console, choose *Get Started* (or *Get Started Now*).
